## Introduction

Fuerte is a community-driven DeFi strategies aggregation and curation platform. We aim to make it easy to build and monetize strategies utilizing DeFi infrastructure, as well as make these strategies accessible to end-users.

The first strategy is built on top of Squeeth – it dynamically hedges exposure around 200% collateralization. The difference with the original Crab vault is that our strategy is based on different rebalancing rules and is designed to capture market inefficiencies in addition to pure volatility play.

## Details

* The website is live at https://fuerte.fi/
* The Squeeth research article was posted in our blog on 2/2/2022 https://fuerte.substack.com/p/a-first-look-at-squeeeeeeth-data
* The strategy does two types of rebalancing – opportunistic (capturing inefficiencies) and forced (pure IV vs RV)
* The research is done, and contracts are being developed

## Milestones

* Deploy contracts to the mainnet and start forwardtesting with the internal capital by the 18th of April
* Post an article with a deep dive into the strategy, including the backtest results
* Open deposits with a limited capacity of 50 ether by the 18th of May
* Increase capacity
* Research more potential strategies utilizing Squeeth and Opyn v2 infrastructure

### Ideal Launch Date

The 18th of May
