## Introduction

An automated strategy that creates a yield-bearing synthetic ETH portfolio by providing liquidity for the ETH-USDC pool on Uniswap V3 and hedging its impermanent losses with LP for the oSQTH-ETH pool.

## Details

The strategy will be implemented as a one-click deposit LP-vault.

## Milestones

## Funding Request and Budget Breakdown

12 ETH

* Design + front-end integration, contract deployment + dev infrastructure, community engagement.
