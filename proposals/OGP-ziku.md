## Introduction

Ziku is a simple interface for beginners to buy options. Users answer a series of questions and will be able to buy options at the end and also learn the basics of options along the way.

## Details

The app is currently live at https://ziku-finance.netlify.app/

Ziku thrives to become the user-friendliest app for options beginners. The main focus is to educate users and make trading less intimidating for them. We plan to write blogs and talk about other strategies in our app. The current "What is an Option?" part of the webpage will change to accommodate those.
