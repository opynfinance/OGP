## Introduction

UniDex aims to bridge concepts from CeFi in traditional markets, and bridge them to DeFi protocols. Our main goal is to create a trading terminal with countless intergrations as we have for swaps, but extend this out derivative products. Liquidity for derivative products can be fragmented and the interfaces can be lacking in similarity from that of platforms like tastytrade or thinkorswim. We plan to build a advanced trading platform and apply our aggregation to derivative products like opyn.

## Details

- We have 2 front ends that are testable currently at unidexbeta.app and alpha.unidexbeta.app with our alpha version being our new UI we're working on and adding options too. 
- We already started on our options UI for our frontend and this is how our near finished product currently is mocked up https://i.imgur.com/rgMR9c1.png. Elements will change as new intergrations come and based on user feedback.
- We want to start with opyn for our first options intergration and built out from there.

## Milestones

- We're trying to get our first release wrapped by the end of next month 
- However the entire UI flushed out by the end of this month or early next month. 

### Ideal Launch Date

July 30th, 2021

## Funding Request and Budget Breakdown

- 20,000 USDC 
- Operating costs mostly come with server costs, contract work, and substaining development of the project overall.
