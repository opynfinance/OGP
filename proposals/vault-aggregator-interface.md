## Introduction

This vault aggregator interface (name recommendations welcome ðŸ˜„) provides users a unified place to view all the various strategies that are available on the Opyn platform (e.g. ribbon.finance, fontis.finance, opeth.finance, optional.finance).

## Details

The interface will look and function similar to other aggregators in the DeFi space, such as Zapper or Zerion, in that it will allow users to easily find, use, and compare automated strategies. The app will focus on being as frictionless as possible, with a low barrier to entry for new users.
In addition to displaying all available and potential positions, it will also show the user's current positions and a leaderboard that ranks strategies and users based on various metrics.
Additional features such as position builders are being considered.
A basic wireframe can be found [here](https://framer.com/projects/Opyn-Aggregator-Wireframe--6GLteVFaNKKS5z6ckEkf-6pUjW).
